Deus Voltz aims to recreate the sensation of playing the classic Voltz pack designed by the Technic team over a decade ago for the first time. Through a combination of olds mods revitalised through modern remakes, new tech mods that fit the thematic scope of Voltz and a plethora of custom designed quests using the FtB Quests system, Deus Voltz will allow players at all stages of familiarity with the original pack to enjoy the throes of geopolitical unrest amongst their friends.

Deus Voltz contains a wide range of technology and quality of life mods that fit the theme of urban warfare. With Lost Cities, Towns and Towers and Village Overhaul, a wide range of urban expanses will spawn in each world that invites players to claim dominion over land and protect or integrate into exisiting societies, all while attempting to grow their influence over the domains of others.

Create: Big Cannons, TAC Z and Ballistix add the much needed firepower to the pack that enables players to feel like they can lead skirmishes against enemies and dominate the battlefield from both near and far. Tactical armour and weapons with Marbled Arsenal add to the immersion and give defenses against the new firepower available to players.

Mekanism, Create, Applied Energistics and Thermal Expansion give the player power to automate everything in their experience down to the minutia, and with logistics and power provided by Pipez and Nuclear Energy, getting automated factories for the player's every need is easier than ever.

Various questlines available to the player through the FtB Quests mod, all custom designed for the modpack, give player's direction on what they should be building and when, as well as providing shortcuts, exchanges and challenges for players looking to reduce grinds preventing them from engaging in warfare or wasting resources. Every quest has awards that help progress the player towards global domination.

With everything mentioned above, plus more that hasn't been touched on, Deus Voltz promises to be an engaging and fierce combatitive experience.
